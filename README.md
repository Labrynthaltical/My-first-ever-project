"Papers & ink" is,as the name suggests,is my first ever project in my career as a front end web developer,showing my current programming skills as well as being a way to improve said skills.

This project consists of pure HTML and CSS codes,no Tailwind or CSS libraries.

The design is made fully by me,although I took some inspiration from other websites similar to my project's idea,with a help of a friend of mine that works as a graphic designer.

This project is about a fictional scholar services agency having the name "Papers & ink".
